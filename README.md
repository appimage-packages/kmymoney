The ultimate objectives of KMyMoney are...

    Accuracy. Using time tested double entry accounting principles KMyMoney can help ensure that your finances are kept in correct order.
    Ease of use. KMyMoney strives to be the easiest open source personal finance manager to use, especially for the non-technical user.
    Familiar Features. KMyMoney intends to provide all important features found in the commercially-available, personal finance managers. The current release is closer than ever to that goal and more improvements are already planned or being tested.
